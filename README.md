Terminal based dungeon crawler text game.

Compile and run main.cpp to play.
Navigate the dungeon (WASD) and pick up gold while avoiding bombs, then make your way to the exit, continue to play the next level.
The dungeon does not get more difficult the more levels you do. 
The amount of gold per pile is 5g.
There is nothing to spend the gold on.
I want to maintain and update this with more features. We'll see how much time I get with school!

Thanks for playing!
